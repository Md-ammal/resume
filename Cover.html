            <p>Dear Teradata,</p>

            <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer Intern position at Teradata, as advertised. With a strong foundation in computer science principles and hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your esteemed organization.</p>

            <p>I am currently pursuing my BCA degree in the field of Computer Science and am in my final semesters, with an expected graduation date in 2025. My coursework has provided me with a solid understanding of programming principles, data structures, algorithms, and databases. Additionally, I have practical experience in Java, C/C++, and PHP, as well as familiarity with webDev technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</p>

            <p>During my academic career, I have undertaken various projects that required strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a team. My experience with SQL, coupled with my excellent troubleshooting and communication skills, makes me confident in my ability to contribute effectively to the Teradata product engineering team.</p>

            <p>I am particularly drawn to Teradata because of its commitment to fostering a dynamic, diverse, and inclusive work environment. The opportunity to work on innovative products like VantageCloud Lake, DataMover, QueryGrid, and Teradata AI Unlimited is incredibly exciting to me. I am eager to bring my passion for technology and my willingness to learn to Teradata's Mexico Intern program and make meaningful contributions to your projects.</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the goals of Teradata.
